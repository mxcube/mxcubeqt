These are executables and GUI files for SOLEIL PX1 and PX2 beamlines

To run mxCuBE:  
  place the files "mxCuBE" and "startGUI" in your path ( "/users/blissadm/bin" )
  copy and modify "mxCuBE" in "/users/blissadm/bin" to point to the right .gui file
    ( you should just need to set the BEAMLINE to either PX1 or PX2 )

In "startGUI" the paths are set for a SOLEIL installation. Be aware that you may need
  to adapt it when installing it at your beamline.

These scripts are set to run mxCuBE without need for an external hardwareRepository server
