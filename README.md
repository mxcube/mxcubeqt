MXCuBE stands for Macromolecular Xtallography Customized Beamline Environment.
The project started in 2005 at [ESRF](http://www.esrf.eu), since then it has
been adopted by other institutes in Europe. In 2010, a collaboration
agreement has been signed for the development of MXCuBE with the following
partners:
* ESRF
* [Soleil](http://www.synchrotron-soleil.fr/)
* [Max IV](https://www.maxiv.lu.se/)
* [HZB](http://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/)
* [EMBL](http://www.embl.org/)
* [Global Phasing Ltd.](http://www.globalphasing.com/)
* [ALBA](https://www.cells.es/en/)
* [DESY](https://www.desy.de/)

Latest information about the MXCuBE project can be found in the
[project webpage](http://mxcube.github.io/mxcube/).
